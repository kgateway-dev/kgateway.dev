Proxy:
  short: "Envoy- or agentgateway-based data plane process that terminates and forwards traffic."
  
  

Rate Limiting:
  short: "Policies that control request rates to protect backends and enforce quotas."
  
  

Resiliency:
  short: "Features that improve reliability, such as retries, timeouts, and circuit breakers."
