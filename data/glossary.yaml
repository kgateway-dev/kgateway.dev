Cluster (Envoy):
  short: "Envoy 'cluster' — a logical grouping of upstream endpoints used for load balancing."
  
  

Control Plane:
  short: "Components that manage and distribute configuration and policies to the data plane."
  
  

Data Plane:
  short: "Proxies (Envoy/agentgateway) and agents that process live network traffic per control-plane config."
  
  

Delegation:
  short: "A pattern to delegate route/policy ownership from a parent route to child routes."

  short: "A policy to return a custom response from the gateway without forwarding to a backend."
  
  

Egress:
  short: "Outbound traffic leaving the mesh/cluster, often routed through egress gateways."
  
  

Envoy:
  short: "High-performance Layer 7 proxy used by Kgateway as the core data plane."

External Authorization:
  short: "Delegate authorization decisions to an external service via an Envoy extension."
  
  

Gateway Extension:
  short: "CR to integrate external services (auth, rate-limit, processors) with a Gateway."
  
  

GatewayParameters:
  short: "Resource that configures proxy template and runtime settings for a Gateway."

Observability (Logging, Monitoring, Tracing):
  short: "Telemetry systems (logs, metrics, traces) used to monitor Kgateway."
  
  

Proxy:
  short: "Envoy- or agentgateway-based data plane process that terminates and forwards traffic."
  
  

Rate Limiting:
  short: "Policies that control request rates to protect backends and enforce quotas."
  
  

Resiliency:
  short: "Traffic-management features (retries, timeouts, circuit breakers) that improve reliability."
  
  

Security:
  short: "Authentication, authorization, encryption and other protections for traffic."
  
  

Service Mesh:
  short: "Infrastructure layer for service-to-service communication; Kgateway supports ambient mesh and Istio."
  
  

Traffic Management:
  short: "Features to control routing, transformations, load balancing and traffic shaping."
