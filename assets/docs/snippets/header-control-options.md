You can configure the header modifier filter at two levels:

* **HTTPRoute**: For the native way in Kubernetes Gateway API, configure a header modifier filter in the HTTPRoute. You can choose to apply the header modifier filter to all the routes that are defined in the HTTPRoute, or to a selection of `backendRefs`. This route-level policy takes precedence over any {{< reuse "docs/snippets/trafficpolicy.md" >}} that you might configure. For more information, see the [Kubernetes Gateway API docs](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/guides/http-header-modifier/).
* **{{< reuse "docs/snippets/trafficpolicy.md" >}} (Envoy-based kgateway proxy only)**: For more flexibility to reuse the header modifier filter across HTTPRoutes, specific routes and Gateways, configure a header modifier filter in the {{< reuse "docs/snippets/trafficpolicy.md" >}}. You can attach a {{< reuse "docs/snippets/trafficpolicy.md" >}} to a Gateway, all HTTPRoutes via `targetRefs`, or an individual route via `extensionRef`. To attach to a `backendRef`, use a header modifier filter in the HTTPRoute instead. For more information about attachment and merging rules, see the [{{< reuse "docs/snippets/trafficpolicy.md" >}} concept docs]({{< link-hextra path="/about/policies/trafficpolicy/" >}}).
