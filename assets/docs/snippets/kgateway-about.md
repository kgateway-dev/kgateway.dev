{{< reuse "docs/snippets/kgateway-capital.md" >}} is a control plane that implements the [Kubernetes Gateway API](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/) for both microservices and AI workloads. The control plane translates your Kubernetes Gateway API resources into the configuration that the underlying data plane proxy can understand. The proxy layer is handled by kgateway's implementation of [Envoy](https://www.envoyproxy.io/) for microservices or [agentgateway](https://agentgateway.dev/) for AI workloads.
