In today's rapidly evolving AI application landscape, effectively monitoring and debugging AI Gateways has become a critical challenge. This article shares my complete experience through the LFX Mentorship program, where I added OpenTelemetry distributed tracing support to kgateway's AI Gateway functionality.

From application strategies for LFX Mentorship to challenges and insights during project implementation, I hope this provides a valuable reference for students who want to participate in open source projects.

## My Background and Preparation

Before applying for LFX Mentorship, I had already been exposed to [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) during my internship, gaining foundational knowledge in the observability domain. More importantly, I participated in the Jaeger community's development work to add Clickhouse support for traces ([PR #6935](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/6935)), which gave me practical experience with distributed tracing.

These experiences made me feel that the LFX Mentorship project about AI Gateway distributed tracing was an excellent opportunity to deepen my learning and contribute to the open source community.

## Application Strategy: Contribute First, Apply Later

I know everyone gets excited when they see a project they're interested in and can't wait to apply. But I adopted a different strategy: **first deeply understand the project, actively participate in the community, then submit the application**.

### Deep Product Experience

Instead of rushing to submit my application, I first went to actually experience the product involved in the project: [AI Gateway](https://kgateway.dev/docs/ai/about/). During usage, I discovered a practical problem - I couldn't directly access the LLM service providers mentioned in the official guide.

### Proactive Problem Solving

I didn't just report the problem, but proactively proposed a solution. I brought up this issue in the community Slack:

{{< reuse-image src="blog/zzk-slack-first-context.png" width="750px" caption="First community interaction">}}

Eventually, I successfully submitted a PR: [Allow overriding default LLM provider endpoints](https://github.com/kgateway-dev/kgateway/pull/11282), which solved this configuration issue.

### Why This Approach Is Important

By contributing code before applying, I achieved several goals:
- **Deep project understanding**: Truly understood the project's architecture and pain points
- **Building trust**: Proved to the mentor that I had the capability to complete project tasks
- **Community integration**: Established connections with community members in advance

## Project Core: Adding Distributed Tracing to AI Gateway

### The Problem to Solve

AI Gateway is implemented using Envoy's extproc functionality, where all requests to LLM service providers are intercepted and processed by the extension program. Currently, AI Gateway has introduced Metrics in the observability domain (Logs, Metrics, Traces). However, when issues occur, Metrics can only tell us 'What' happened, but not 'Where' the issue occurred, we can only sift through massive amounts of logs for troubleshooting, which is both time-consuming and inefficient.

Distributed tracing can help us:
- **Visualize request flow**: Clearly see the complete path of requests through the system
- **Rapid problem identification**: Quickly find issues by querying failed requests (like `attributes.http.status=400`)
- **Performance analysis**: Understand latency at various stages
- **Monitor LLM calls**: Track calls and performance across different LLM service providers

### Project Goals

Our goal was to provide complete observability support for AI Gateway:

1. **Configuration flexibility**: Users can configure OpenTelemetry tracer and Span Exporter
2. **Standardized tracing**: Follow [OpenTelemetry's GenAI semantic conventions](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/gen-ai/gen-ai-spans/)
3. **Multi-vendor support**: Support multiple LLM service providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Gemini
4. **Ease of use**: Provide simple configuration methods and clear documentation

### Design Approach

The project was divided into two main parts. For more details, see: [EP-11777](https://github.com/kgateway-dev/kgateway/blob/main/design/11177.md):

**Control Plane**: Provides configuration interface through GatewayParameters API, where users can specify tracing backends, sampling rates, and other parameters.

**Data Plane**: Implements actual distributed tracing logic in the AI extension server, collecting and exporting trace data.

The key challenge was handling response format differences across different LLM service providers. Each provider's API response structure is different, requiring us to uniformly extract key information such as model names, token usage, response status, etc., and format them according to OpenTelemetry standards.

## Important Lessons from the Development Process

### Critical Testing Strategy Lessons

Early in the project, I made an important mistake: skipping unit tests and going directly to E2E testing. At the time, I chose to send generated traces directly to Tempo for verification. While installing Tempo and Grafana via Helm was simple, and I could clearly observe trace generation after sending requests to the gateway, this approach became extremely complex when writing automated tests.

**The Problems**:
- Needed to write complex TraceQL queries to verify data
- TraceQL syntax was difficult to debug, consuming significant time
- Test environment configuration was complex and hard to maintain

**Better Solution**:
After discussions with my mentor, Nina, I learned that the system already had a simpler method: send traces to OTel Collector and have the Collector output structured logs. This way, we could directly retrieve all traces data from container logs using `kubectl logs`, greatly simplifying the testing process.

### Key Takeaways

1. **Write unit tests first**: Unit tests can verify core logic faster, avoiding debugging in complex integration environments
2. **Seek help promptly**: When encountering difficulties, don't go down rabbit holes alone - mentor experience can help you avoid detours
3. **Understand existing tools**: Fully understand the project's existing testing tools and methods to avoid reinventing the wheel

### Community Collaboration

Throughout the development process, support from the kgateway community was crucial. Whether for technical discussions or code review feedback, community members were always very helpful. This gave me a deep appreciation for the collaborative spirit of open source projects.

## Project Results and Value

### Implemented Features

Through this project, we added complete distributed tracing support to kgateway's AI Gateway:

- **Unified configuration interface**: Users can easily configure distributed tracing through GatewayParameters
- **Multi-vendor support**: Support for mainstream LLM service providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Gemini
- **Standardized tracing**: Follows OpenTelemetry GenAI semantic conventions
- **Flexible deployment**: Supports sending to any OTLP-compatible backend storage

### How to Experience the Distributed Tracing Feature

Want to experience this distributed tracing feature yourself? Follow these steps to quickly set up a complete test environment:

#### 1. Install Gateway
Follow the [Get started](https://kgateway.dev/docs/quickstart/) guide. For the installation, choose the development version, v{{< reuse "docs/versions/patch-dev.md" >}}.

#### 2. Enable AI Extension
As you follow the [Set up AI Gateway](https://kgateway.dev/docs/ai/setup/), note the following configurations:

Upgrade kgateway and enable AI Gateway extension:
```bash
helm upgrade -i -n kgateway-system kgateway oci://cr.kgateway.dev/kgateway-dev/charts/kgateway \
    --set gateway.aiExtension.enabled=true \
    --version v2.1.0-main
```

Create GatewayParameters resource with distributed tracing configuration:
```yaml
kubectl apply -f- <<EOF
apiVersion: gateway.kgateway.dev/v1alpha1
kind: GatewayParameters
metadata:
  name: ai-gateway
  namespace: kgateway-system
spec:
  kube:
    aiExtension:
      enabled: true
      ports:
        - name: ai-monitoring
          containerPort: 9092
      tracing:
        endpoint: "http://opentelemetry-collector-traces.telemetry:4317"
        sampler:
          type: "alwaysOn"
      env:
        - name: LOG_LEVEL
          value: DEBUG
    service:
      type: NodePort
EOF
```

#### 3. Deploy OTel Stack
We only need the traces components. If you need other features (logs, metrics), please refer to: [OTel Stack](https://kgateway.dev/docs/observability/otel-stack/)

Install Tempo:
```bash
helm upgrade --install tempo tempo \
  --repo https://grafana.github.io/helm-charts \
  --version 1.16.0 \
  --namespace telemetry \
  --create-namespace \
  --values - <<EOF
persistence:
  enabled: false
tempo:
  receivers:
    otlp:
      protocols:
        grpc:
          endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4317
EOF
```

Install OTel Collector:
```bash
helm upgrade --install opentelemetry-collector-traces opentelemetry-collector \
  --repo https://open-telemetry.github.io/opentelemetry-helm-charts \
  --version 0.127.2 \
  --set mode=deployment \
  --set image.repository="otel/opentelemetry-collector-contrib" \
  --set command.name="otelcol-contrib" \
  --namespace=telemetry \
  --create-namespace \
  -f -<<EOF
config:
  receivers:
    otlp:
      protocols:
        grpc:
          endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4317
        http:
          endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4318
  exporters:
    otlp/tempo:
      endpoint: http://tempo.telemetry.svc.cluster.local:4317
      tls:
        insecure: true
    debug:
      verbosity: detailed
  service:
    pipelines:
      traces:
        receivers: [otlp]
        processors: [batch]
        exporters: [debug, otlp/tempo]
EOF
```

Configure Grafana for more intuitive trace observation

Install Grafana using [deploy-grafana-using-helm-charts](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/setup-grafana/installation/helm/#deploy-grafana-using-helm-charts).

Configure Tempo as a data source, and fill in the URL field with: `http://tempo.telemetry:3100`
{{< reuse-image src="blog/config-data-source-tempo.png" width="750px" caption="Configure Tempo as data source">}}

#### 4. Create Tracing Policy
```yaml
kubectl apply -f- <<EOF
apiVersion: gateway.kgateway.dev/v1alpha1
kind: HTTPListenerPolicy
metadata:
  name: tracing-policy
  namespace: kgateway-system
spec:
  targetRefs:
    - group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
      kind: Gateway
      name: ai-gateway
  tracing:
    provider:
      openTelemetry:
        serviceName: http
        grpcService:
          backendRef:
            name: otel-collector-traces
            namespace: telemetry
            port: 4317
    spawnUpstreamSpan: true
EOF
```

#### 5. Send Test Request
Send a test request using [Ollama for local LLMs](https://kgateway.dev/docs/ai/ollama/):

```bash
curl -v "localhost:8080/ollama" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
        "model": "llama3.2",
        "messages": [
            {
                "role": "system",
                "content": "You are a helpful assistant."
            },
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": "Hello!"
            }
        ]
    }' | jq
```

#### 6. Verify Distributed Tracing
Check if traces are being collected properly via command line:

```bash
kubectl -n telemetry logs deploy/opentelemetry-collector-traces | grep 'llama'
```

You should see output similar to this:
```
Name           : gen_ai.request generate_content llama3.2
    -> gen_ai.request.model: Str(llama3.2)
    -> gen_ai.response.model: Str(llama3.2)
```

Observe traces more intuitively through Grafana:
