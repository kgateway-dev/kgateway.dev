When deploying workloads that rely on large language models (LLMs) in production, an important, yet often overlooked, challenge is LLM reliability. Models can go offline for all sorts of reasons: infrastructure hiccups, resource constraints, or version rollouts gone awry.

When that happens, your AI-powered workloads are left with no response. Especially in complex agentic setups that rely on several LLM interactions, such disruption can significantly impact the user experience.

With kgateway, you can set up prioritized model load-balancing to keep the LLM responses flowing.

## What is model priority?

Model priority is the process of prioritizing models so that kgateway routes requests first to your preferred model. If that primary model becomes unavailable, starts returning errors, or can no longer be accessed, such as due to rate limits or tiered plan limits, you can further configure kgateway to failover to the next model.

## What about load balancing?

Load balancing distributes incoming requests across multiple models by priority. This isn't only about performanceâ€”it's also a way to gracefully scale and prepare for sudden traffic spikes or partial failures.

## How model priority and load balancing work together

- Load balancing helps distribute requests across healthy models
- Priority ensures that requests go first to your preferred, healthy model

## Example scenario

Let's take a look at how we can set up model priority with kgateway. As shown in Figure 1, kgateway prioritizes requests across three models from the OpenAI LLM provider: the primary gpt-4o model and two fallback models, gpt-4-turbo and gpt-3.5-turbo.

## Before you begin

Make sure that you have a basic kgateway environment set up with AI Gateway and your LLM provider. If you don't, check out these docs:

- [Get started with kgateway](https://kgateway.dev/docs/quickstart/)
- [Set up AI Gateway](https://kgateway.dev/docs/ai/setup/)
- [Authenticate to the LLM provider](https://kgateway.dev/docs/ai/auth/)

## Step 1: Create a Backend for your models

In kgateway, a Backend represents a service that you want to route traffic to. It includes special capabilities, including the ability to represent an AI backing service. The following Backend sets up a pool of models to route to in a prioritized order:

- gpt-4o model
- gpt-4.0-turbo model
- gpt-3.5-turbo model

      - openai:
          model: "gpt-3.5-turbo"
        authToken:
          kind: SecretRef
          secretRef:
            name: openai-secret

            authToken:

              secretRef:

            openai:
              model: "gpt-4.0-turbo"
            authToken:
              kind: SecretRef
              secretRef:
                name: openai-secret
      - pool:
        - provider:
            openai:
              model: "gpt-3.5-turbo"
            authToken:
              kind: SecretRef
              secretRef:
                name: openai-secret
EOF
```
{{% /tab %}}
{{< /tabs >}}

## Step 2: Create an HTTPRoute to the Backend

Create an HTTPRoute resource that routes incoming traffic on the */openai* path to the Backend that you created in the previous step. AI Gateway automatically rewrites this path to the API path of a supported LLM, such as */v1/chat/completions* in OpenAI.

The parent of the HTTPRoute is the AI Gateway that you created before you began. If you used a different Gateway, make sure to update the resource accordingly.

```yaml
kubectl apply -f- <<EOF
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: HTTPRoute
metadata:
  name: model-priority
  namespace: kgateway-system
  labels:
    app: model-priority
spec:
  parentRefs:
  - name: ai-gateway
    namespace: kgateway-system
  rules:
  - matches:
    - path:
        type: PathPrefix
        value: /openai
    backendRefs:
    - name: model-priority
      namespace: kgateway-system
      group: gateway.kgateway.dev
      kind: Backend
EOF
```

## Step 3: Try it out

Now that you have the routing set up to your AI Backend's pool of models, it's time to try out a request.

Get the IP address of your AI Gateway, such as with the following command.

```yaml
export INGRESS_GW_ADDRESS=$(kubectl get svc -n kgateway-system ai-gateway -o jsonpath="{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0]['hostname','ip']}")
echo $INGRESS_GW_ADDRESS
```

Now, send a request to the AI Gateway along the */openai* path that you previously configured in the HTTPRoute. Behind the scenes, AI Gateway forwards this request to the OpenAI provider model in the order of priority that you set up in the Backend.

```yaml
curl -v "$INGRESS_GW_ADDRESS:8080/openai" -H content-type:application/json -d '{
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "What is kubernetes?"
    }
  ]}' | jq
```

In the output, notice that the response is from the gpt-4o model, which is the first model in the priority order from the Backend.

```yaml
{
  "id": "chatcmpl-BFQ8Lldo9kLC56S1DFVbIonOQll9t",
  "object": "chat.completion",
  "created": 1743015077,
  "model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06",

## Conclusion

Nice job! You tried out prioritizing models to prepare for failover by creating a kgateway Backend and a couple Gateway API resources. With kgateway's resiliency features on set up, your AI workloads can bounce back fast in the face of unexpected failures.
