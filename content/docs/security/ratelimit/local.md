## About {#about}

Local rate limiting is a coarse-grained rate limiting capability that is primarily used as a first line of defense mechanism to limit the number of requests that are forwarded to your rate limit servers. 

Without local rate limiting, all requests are directly forwarded to a rate limit server that you set up where the request is either denied or allowed based on the global rate limiting settings that you configured. However, during an attack, too many requests might be forwarded to your rate limit servers and can cause overload or even failure.

To protect your rate limit servers from being overloaded and to optimize their resource utilization, you can set up local rate limiting in conjunction with global rate limiting. Because local rate limiting is enforced in each Envoy instance that makes up your gateway, no rate limit server is required in this setup. For example, if you have 5 Envoy instances that together represent your gateway, each instance is configured with the limit that you set. 

For more information about local rate limiting, see the [Envoy documentation](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/configuration/http/http_filters/local_rate_limit_filter). 

### Architecture

The following image shows how local rate limiting works in {{< reuse "/docs/snippets/kgateway.md" >}}. As clients send requests to a backend destination, they first reach the Envoy instance that represents your gateway. Local rate limiting settings are applied to an Envoy pod or process. Note that limits are applied to each pod or process. For example, if you have 5 Envoy instances that are configured with a local rate limit of 10 requests per second, the total number of allowed requests per second is 50 (5 x 10). In a global rate limiting setup, this limit is shared between all Envoy instances, so the total number of allowed requests per second is 10. 

Depending on your setup, each Envoy instance or pod is configured with a number of tokens in a token bucket. To allow a request, a token must be available in the bucket so that it can be assigned to a downstream connection. Token buckets are refilled occasionally as defined in the refill setting of the local rate limiting configuration. If no token is available, the connection is closed immediately, and a 429 HTTP response code is returned to the client. 

When a token is available in the token bucket it can be assigned to an incoming connection. The request is then forwarded to your rate limit server to enforce any global rate limiting settings. For example, the request might be further rate limited based on headers or query parameters. Only requests that are within the local and global rate limits are forwarded to the backend destination in the cluster.

### Local rate limiting

In kgateway, you use a [TrafficPolicy](/docs/about/policies/trafficpolicy/) to set up local rate limiting for your routes. You can choose between the following attachment options: 
* **A particular route in an HTTPRoute resource**: Use the `extensionRef` filter in the HTTPRoute to attach the TrafficPolicy to the route you want to rate limit. For an example, see [Route configuration](#route). 
* **All routes in an HTTPRoute**: Use the `targetRefs` section in the TrafficPolicy to attach the policy to a particular HTTPRoute resource. 
* **All routes that the Gateway serves**: Use the `targetRefs` section in the TrafficPolicy to attach the policy to a Gateway. For an example, see [Gateway configuration](#gateway). 

Note that if you apply a TrafficPolicy to an HTTPRoute and to a Gateway at the same time, the HTTPRoute policy takes precedence. For more information, see [Multiple `targetRefs` TrafficPolicies](/docs/about/policies/trafficpolicy/#multiple-targetrefs-TrafficPolicies). 

## Before you begin

{{< reuse "docs/snippets/prereq.md" >}}

## Route configuration {#route}

Set up local rate limiting for a particular route. 

1. Create a TrafficPolicy with your local rate limiting settings. 
   ```yaml
   kubectl apply -f- <<EOF
   apiVersion: gateway.kgateway.dev/v1alpha1
   kind: TrafficPolicy
   metadata:
     name: local-ratelimit
     namespace: httpbin
   spec:
     rateLimit:
       local:
         tokenBucket:
           maxTokens: 1
           tokensPerFill: 1
           fillInterval: 100s
   EOF
   ```

   | Setting | Description |
   | ------- | ----------- |
   | `maxTokens` | The maximum number of tokens that are available to use.   |
   | `tokensPerFill` | The number of tokens that are added during a refill.  |
   | `fillIntervall` | The number of seconds, after which the token bucket is refilled. |

2. Create an HTTPRoute that limits requests to the httpbin app along the `ratelimit.example` domain. To apply the TrafficPolicy that created earlier, you use the `extensionRef` filter. 
   ```yaml
   kubectl apply -f- <<EOF
   apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
   kind: HTTPRoute
   metadata:
     name: httpbin-ratelimit
     namespace: httpbin
   spec:
     parentRefs:
     - name: http
       namespace: {{< reuse "docs/snippets/namespace.md" >}}
     hostnames:
     - ratelimit.example
     rules:
     - matches:
       - path:
           type: PathPrefix
           value: /
       filters:
       - type: ExtensionRef
         extensionRef:
           name: local-ratelimit
           group: gateway.kgateway.dev
           kind: TrafficPolicy
       backendRefs:
       - name: httpbin
         port: 8000
   EOF
   ```

3. Send a request to the httpbin app. Verify that you get back a 200 HTTP response code. 
   {{< tabs tabTotal="2" items="Cloud Provider LoadBalancer,Port-forward for local testing" >}}
   {{% tab tabName="Cloud Provider LoadBalancer" %}}
   ```sh
   curl -vi http://$INGRESS_GW_ADDRESS:8080/status/200 -H "host: ratelimit.example:8080"
   ```
   {{% /tab %}}
   {{% tab tabName="Port-forward for local testing" %}}
   ```sh
   curl -vi localhost:8080/status/200 -H "host: ratelimit.example"
   ```
   {{% /tab %}}
   {{< /tabs >}}
   
   Example output: 
   ```
   * Request completely sent off
   < HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   < access-control-allow-credentials: true
   access-control-allow-credentials: true
   < access-control-allow-origin: *

   content-length: 0
   < x-envoy-upstream-service-time: 1
   x-envoy-upstream-service-time: 1
   < server: envoy
   server: envoy
   ```
   
4. Send another request to the httpbin app. Note that this time the request is denied with a 429 HTTP response code and a `local_rate_limited` message in your CLI output. Because the route is configured with only 1 token that is refilled every 100 seconds, the token was assigned to the connection of the first request. No tokens were available to be assigned to the second request. If you wait for 100 seconds, the token bucket is refilled and a new connection can be accepted by the route. 
   {{< tabs tabTotal="2" items="Cloud Provider LoadBalancer,Port-forward for local testing" >}}
   {{% tab tabName="Cloud Provider LoadBalancer" %}}
   ```sh
   curl -vi http://$INGRESS_GW_ADDRESS:8080/status/200 -H "host: ratelimit.example:8080"
   ```
   {{% /tab %}}
   {{% tab tabName="Port-forward for local testing" %}}
   ```sh
   curl -vi localhost:8080/status/200 -H "host: ratelimit.example"
   ```
   {{% /tab %}}
   {{< /tabs >}}

   Example output:
   ```
   ...
   * Mark bundle as not supporting multiuse
   < HTTP/1.1 429 Too Many Requests
   HTTP/1.1 429 Too Many Requests
   < x-ratelimit-limit: 1

   < x-ratelimit-reset: 79
   x-ratelimit-reset: 79
   ...
   Connection #0 to host 34.XXX.XX.XXX left intact
   local_rate_limited      
   ```
   
## Gateway configuration {#gateway}

Instead of applying local rate limiting to a particular route, you can also apply it to an entire gateway. This way, the local rate limiting settings are applied to all the routes that the gateway serves. 

1. Create a TrafficPolicy with your local rate limiting settings. Use the `targetRefs` section to apply the policy to a specific Gateway. The policy automatically applies to all the routes that the Gateway serves. 
   ```yaml
   kubectl apply -f- <<EOF
   apiVersion: gateway.kgateway.dev/v1alpha1
   kind: TrafficPolicy
   metadata:
     name: local-ratelimit
     namespace: {{< reuse "docs/snippets/namespace.md" >}}
   spec:
     targetRefs: 
     - group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
       kind: Gateway
       name: http
     rateLimit:
       local:
         tokenBucket:
           maxTokens: 1
           tokensPerFill: 1
           fillInterval: 100s
   EOF
   ```

   | Setting | Description |
   | ------- | ----------- |
   | `targetRefs`| Select the Gateway that you want to apply your local rate limiting configuration to. In this example, the policy is applied to all the routes that the `http` gateway serves.  |
   | `maxTokens` | The maximum number of tokens that are available to use.   |
   | `tokensPerFill` | The number of tokens that are added during a refill.  |
   | `fillIntervall` | The number of seconds, after which the token bucket is refilled. |
   
3. Send a request to the httpbin app alongside the `www.example.com` domain that you set up as part of the getting started tutorial. Verify that the request succeeds.
   {{< tabs tabTotal="2" items="Cloud Provider LoadBalancer,Port-forward for local testing" >}}
   {{% tab tabName="Cloud Provider LoadBalancer" %}}
   ```sh
   curl -vi http://$INGRESS_GW_ADDRESS:8080/status/200 -H "host: www.example.com:8080"
   ```
   {{% /tab %}}
   {{% tab tabName="Port-forward for local testing" %}}
   ```sh
   curl -vi localhost:8080/status/200 -H "host: www.example.com"
   ```
   {{% /tab %}}
   {{< /tabs >}}
   
   Example output: 
   ```
   * Request completely sent off
   < HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   < access-control-allow-credentials: true
   access-control-allow-credentials: true
   < access-control-allow-origin: *
   access-control-allow-origin: *
   < content-length: 0
   content-length: 0
   < x-envoy-upstream-service-time: 1
   x-envoy-upstream-service-time: 1
   < server: envoy
   server: envoy
   ```

4. Send another request to the httpbin app. Note that this time the request is denied with a 429 HTTP response code and a `local_rate_limited` message in your CLI output. Because the gateway is configured with only 1 token that is refilled every 100 seconds, the token was assigned to the connection of the first request. No tokens were available to be assigned to the second request. If you wait for 100 seconds, the token bucket is refilled and a new connection can be accepted by the gateway. 
   {{< tabs tabTotal="2" items="Cloud Provider LoadBalancer,Port-forward for local testing" >}}
   {{% tab tabName="Cloud Provider LoadBalancer" %}}
   ```sh
   curl -vi http://$INGRESS_GW_ADDRESS:8080/status/200 -H "host: www.example.com:8080"
   ```
   {{% /tab %}}
   {{% tab tabName="Port-forward for local testing" %}}
   ```sh
   curl -vi localhost:8080/status/200 -H "host: www.example.com"
   ```
   {{% /tab %}}
   {{< /tabs >}}

   Example output:
   ```
   ...
   * Mark bundle as not supporting multiuse
   < HTTP/1.1 429 Too Many Requests

   local_rate_limited      
   ```

## Disable rate limiting for a route {#disable-route}

Sometimes, you might want to disable rate limiting for a route. For example, you might have system critical routes that should be accessible even under high traffic conditions, such as a health check or admin endpoints. You can exclude a route from rate limiting by setting `rateLimit.local` to `{}` in the TrafficPolicy. 

1. Create a Gateway-level TrafficPolicy to enforce local rate limiting on all routes. For more information, refer to the [Gateway configuration](#gateway).

   ```yaml
   kubectl apply -f- <<EOF
   apiVersion: gateway.kgateway.dev/v1alpha1
   kind: TrafficPolicy
   metadata:
     name: local-ratelimit
     namespace: {{< reuse "docs/snippets/namespace.md" >}}
   spec:
     targetRefs: 
     - group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
       kind: Gateway
       name: http
     rateLimit:
       local:
         tokenBucket:
           maxTokens: 1
           tokensPerFill: 1
           fillInterval: 100s
   EOF
   ```

2. Create an HTTPRoute for the route that you want to exclude from rate limiting, such as `/anything` on the `httpbin` app. Note that because no TrafficPolicy applies to this HTTPRoute yet, the Gateway-level rate limit policy is enforced for the `/anything` route.

   ```yaml
   kubectl apply -f- <<EOF
   apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
   kind: HTTPRoute
   metadata:
     name: httpbin-anything
     namespace: httpbin
   spec:
     parentRefs:
     - name: http
       namespace: {{< reuse "docs/snippets/namespace.md" >}}
     hostnames:
     - www.example.com
     rules:
     - matches:
       - path:
           type: PathPrefix
           value: /anything
       backendRefs:
       - name: httpbin
         port: 8000
   EOF
   ```

3. Send two requests to verify that the route is rate limited due to the Gateway-level TrafficPolicy that allows only 1 request per 100 seconds.

   {{< tabs tabTotal="2" items="Cloud Provider LoadBalancer,Port-forward for local testing" >}}
   {{% tab tabName="Cloud Provider LoadBalancer" %}}
   ```sh
   for i in {1..2}; do curl -vi http://$INGRESS_GW_ADDRESS:8080/anything -H "host: www.example.com:8080"; done
   ```
   {{% /tab %}}
   {{% tab tabName="Port-forward for local testing" %}}
   ```sh
   for i in {1..2}; do curl -vi localhost:8080/anything -H "host: www.example.com"; done
   ```
   {{% /tab %}}
   {{< /tabs >}}

   Example output: Verify that the first request succeeds and the second request is rate limited.
   
   Request 1:
   ```
   < HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   HTTP/1.1 200 OK   
   ...
   ```

   Request 2:
   ```
   < HTTP/1.1 429 Too Many Requests
   HTTP/1.1 429 Too Many Requests
   < x-ratelimit-limit: 1
   x-ratelimit-limit: 1
   < x-ratelimit-remaining: 0
   x-ratelimit-remaining: 0
   < x-ratelimit-reset: 79
   x-ratelimit-reset: 79
   ...
   Connection #0 to host 34.XXX.XX.XXX left intact
   local_rate_limited      
   ```

4. Create a TrafficPolicy to disable rate limiting for the HTTPRoute.

   ```yaml
   kubectl apply -f- <<EOF
   apiVersion: gateway.kgateway.dev/v1alpha1
   kind: TrafficPolicy
   metadata:
     name: disable-ratelimit
     namespace: httpbin
   spec:
     targetRefs:
     - group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
       kind: HTTPRoute
       name: httpbin-anything
     rateLimit:
       local: {}
   EOF
   ```

5. Repeat the requests. This time, the requests succeed because the HTTPRoute is excluded from rate limiting.

   {{< tabs tabTotal="2" items="Cloud Provider LoadBalancer,Port-forward for local testing" >}}
   {{% tab tabName="Cloud Provider LoadBalancer" %}}
   ```sh
   for i in {1..2}; do curl -vi http://$INGRESS_GW_ADDRESS:8080/anything -H "host: www.example.com:8080"; done
   ```
   {{% /tab %}}
   {{% tab tabName="Port-forward for local testing" %}}
   ```sh
   for i in {1..2}; do curl -vi localhost:8080/anything -H "host: www.example.com"; done
   ```
   {{% /tab %}}
   {{< /tabs >}}

   Example output:
   
   Request 1:
   ```
   < HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   HTTP/1.1 200 OK   
   ...
   ```

   Request 2:
   ```
   < HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   HTTP/1.1 200 OK   
   ...
