Enforce client-site access controls with cross-origin resource sharing (CORS).

## About CORS

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a security feature that is implemented by web browsers and that controls how web pages in one domain can request and interact with resources that are hosted on a different domain. By default, web browsers only allow requests to resources that are hosted on the same domain as the web page that served the original request. Access to web pages or resources that are hosted on a different domain is restricted to prevent potential security vulnerabilities, such as cross-site request forgery (CRSF).

When CORS is enabled in a web browser and a request for a different domain comes in, the web browser checks whether this request is allowed or not. To do that, it typically sends a preflight request (HTTP `OPTIONS` method) to the server or service that serves the requested resource. The service returns the methods that are permitted to send the actual cross-origin request, such as GET, POST, etc. If the request to the different domain is allowed, the response includes CORS-specific headers that instruct the web browser how to make the cross-origin request. For example, the CORS headers typically include the origin that is allowed to access the resource, and the credentials or headers that must be included in the cross-origin request.

Note that the preflight request is optional. Web browsers can also be configured to send the cross-origin directly. However, access to the request resource is granted only if CORS headers were returned in the response. If no headers are returned during the preflight request, the web browser denies access to the resource in the other domain.

CORS policies are typically implemented to limit access to server resources for JavaScripts that are embedded in a web page, such as:

* A JavaScript on a web page at `example.com` tries to access a different domain, such as `api.com`.
* A JavaScript on a web page at `example.com` tries to access a different subdomain, such as `api.example.com`.
* A JavaScript on a web page at `example.com` tries to access a different port, such as `example.com:3001`.
* A JavaScript on a web page at `https://example.com` tries to access the resources by using a different protocol, such as `http://example.com`.

Some apps, such as `httpbin`, have built-in CORS policies that allow all origins. These policies take precedence over CORS policies that you might configure in {{< reuse "docs/snippets/product-name.md" >}}.

## Before you begin

{{< reuse "docs/snippets/prereq.md" >}}

### Set up your environment to test CORS {#setup-env}

Set up the {{< reuse "docs/snippets/k8s-gateway-api-name.md" >}} CRDs and the Petstore app to test CORS policies.

1. Install the experimental channel of the {{< reuse "docs/snippets/k8s-gateway-api-name.md" >}} so that you can use CORS.

   ```shell
   kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/releases/download/v{{< reuse "docs/versions/k8s-gw-version.md" >}}/experimental-install.yaml
   ```

2. Deploy the sample Petstore app. You cannot use the sample httpbin app, because httpbin has built-in CORS policies that allow all origins. These policies take precedence over CORS policies that you configure in {{< reuse "docs/snippets/product-name.md" >}}.
   
   ```sh
   kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kgateway-dev/kgateway.dev/refs/heads/main/assets/docs/examples/petstore.yaml
   ```
   
   Example output: 
   
   ```console
   deployment.apps/petstore created
   service/petstore created
   ```

3. Verify that the Petstore app is up and running. 
   
   ```sh
   kubectl get pods   
   ```
   
   Example output: 
   ```console                                                                              
   NAME                        READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
   petstore-66cddd5bb4-x7vdd   1/1     Running   0          26s
   ```


## Set up CORS policies

Use the {{< reuse "docs/snippets/k8s-gateway-api-name.md" >}} CRDs to create CORS policies.

1. Create an HTTPRoute resource for the Petstore app that applies a CORS filter. The following example allows requests from the `example.com/` and `*.example.com` origins.

   ```yaml
   kubectl apply -f- <<EOF
   apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
   kind: HTTPRoute
   metadata:
     name: petstore-cors
     namespace: default
   spec:
     parentRefs:
     - name: http
       namespace: {{< reuse "docs/snippets/ns-system.md" >}}
     hostnames:
       - cors.example
     rules:
       - filters:
         - type: CORS
           cors:
           - allowCredentials: true
             allowOrigins:
             - "https://example.com/"
             allowMethods: 
             - GET
             - POST
             - OPTIONS
             allowHeaders: 
             - origin
         - type: ResponseHeaderModifier
           responseHeaderModifier:
             add:
               - name: Access-Control-Expose-Headers
                 value: "origin, vh-header"
               - name: Access-Control-Max-Age
                 value: "86400"
         backendRefs:
           - name: petstore
             port: 8080
   EOF
   ```

2. Send a request to the Petstore app on the `cors.example` domain and use `https://example.com/` as the origin. Verify that your request succeeds and that you get back CORS headers, such as `access-control-allow-origin`, `access-control-allow-credentials`, and `access-control-expose-headers`. 
   
   {{< tabs items="LoadBalancer IP address or hostname,Port-forward for local testing" >}}
   {{% tab  %}}
   ```sh
   curl -v -X GET http://$INGRESS_GW_ADDRESS:8080/api/pets -H "host: cors.example:8080" \
    -H "Origin: https://example.com/" -H "Access-Control-Request-Method: GET"
   ```
   {{% /tab %}}
   {{% tab  %}}
   ```sh
   curl -v -X GET localhost:8080/api/pets -H "host: cors.example:8080" \
    -H "Origin: https://example.com/" -H "Access-Control-Request-Method: GET"
   ```
   {{% /tab %}}
   {{< /tabs >}}
   
   Example output: Notice that the `access-control-expose-headers` value changes depending on the resources that you created.
   * If you created only a VirtualHostOption, you see the `origin` and `vh-header` headers.
   * If you created only a RouteOption or both a RouteOption and VirtualHostOption, you see the `origin` and `route-header` headers, because the RouteOption takes precedence. 
   * If you created both options and also configured the `corsPolicyMergeSettings` on the VirtualHostOptions with a `UNION` merge strategy, then you see all the `origin`, `vh-header`, and `route-header` headers.
   ```console {hl_lines=[7,8,9]}
   * Mark bundle as not supporting multiuse

   < server: envoy
   < 
   [{"id":1,"name":"Dog","status":"available"},{"id":2,"name":"Cat","status":"pending"}]
   ```
   
3. Send another request to the Petstore app. This time, you use `notallowed.com` as your origin. Although the request succeeds, you do not get back any CORS headers, because `notallowed.com` is not configured as a supported origin.  
   
   {{< tabs items="LoadBalancer IP address or hostname,Port-forward for local testing" >}}
   {{% tab %}}
   ```sh
   curl -v -X GET http://$INGRESS_GW_ADDRESS:8080/api/pets -H "host: cors.example:8080" \
    -H "Origin: https://notallowed.com/" -H "Access-Control-Request-Method: GET"
   ```
   {{% /tab %}}
   {{% tab  %}}
   ```sh
   curl -v -X GET localhost:8080/api/pets -H "host: cors.example:8080" \
    -H "Origin: https://notallowed.com/" -H "Access-Control-Request-Method: GET"
   ```
   {{% /tab %}}
   {{< /tabs >}}
   
   Example output: 
   ```console
   * Mark bundle as not supporting multiuse
   < HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   < content-type: text/xml
   < date: Mon, 03 Jun 2024 17:20:10 GMT

   ```
