Use a Backend resource to define a backing destination that you want kgateway to route to. A Backend destination is external to the cluster and, as such, cannot be represented as a Kubernetes Service. For more information, see the [Backend API docs](/docs/reference/api/#backend). 

## Types

Check out the following guides for examples on how to use the supported Backends types with kgateway.

## Routing

You can route to a Backend by simply referencing that Backend in the `backendRefs` section of your HTTPRoute resource as shown in the following example. Note that if your Backend and HTTPRoute resources exist in different namespaces, you must create a Kubernetes ReferenceGrant resource to allow the HTTPRoute to access the Backend.

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
Do not specify a port in the `spec.backendRefs.port` field when referencing your Backend. The port is defined in your Backend resource instead. If port is set on the HTTPRoute resource, the status returns a `Reason:BackendNotFound` message.

```yaml {linenos=table,hl_lines=[13,14,15,16],linenostart=1,filename="backend-httproute.yaml"}
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: HTTPRoute
metadata:
  name: static-backend
  namespace: default
spec:
  parentRefs:
  - name: http
    namespace: kgateway-system
  hostnames:
    - static.example
     rules:
       - backendRefs:
         - name: json-backend
           kind: Backend
           group: gateway.kgateway.dev
         filters:
         - type: URLRewrite
           urlRewrite:
             hostname: jsonplaceholder.typicode.com
   EOF
```

For an example, see the [Static](/docs/traffic-management/destination-types/backends/static/) Backend guide.
