Enable TCP keepalive on downstream and backend connections.

## About TCP keepalive {#about}

TCP keepalive helps you provide stable connections in two main ways:

1) Keep the connection alive by sending out probes after the connection has been idle for a specific amount of time. This way, the connection does not have to be reestablished repeatedly, which could otherwise lead to latency spikes.
2) Detect and close stale connections when the probe fails, such as due to firewall or other network security settings. This way, you can avoid longer timeouts and retries on broken connections.

### Settings to configure TCP keepalive {#settings}

To configure TCP keepalive, you can use three settings. For more information, see the [Linux TCP manual page](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/tcp.7.html).

| Setting | Default value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| tcp_keepalive_intvl | 75 | The number of seconds between probes. |
| tcp_keepalive_probes | 9 | The number of probes to send before closing the connection. |
| tcp_keepalive_time | 7200 | The number of seconds that a connection stays idle before probes are sent. |

### Guidance for settings {#guidance}

To help determine the right settings for your network environment, consider your app traffic patterns and the desired user experience. You might also find the following guidelines helpful.

* On a slow or lossy network, if `tcp_keepalive_intvl` or `tcp_keepalive_probes` values are set too low, you might generate unnecessary traffic or inadvertently drop the connections more often than needed.
* If you set the probe intervals or keepalive time durations too high, you might not detect broken connections soon enough.
* Many application layer protocols like HTTP and gRPC (using HTTP/2) have their own keepalive mechanisms that can change what you otherwise expect from the TCP keepalive. For example, the application might still close the connection after the keepalive timeout, even if TCP keepalive is in place. This unexpected closure happens because the TCP keepalive probe does not get up to the application layer.  

### Use cases for TCP keepalive {#use-cases}

**Stale connections**

Because closing a TCP connection involves a four-way handshake, you might notice stale connections arise in an unstable network, where one side has been responding but the other side has not detected a response yet. Both sides might listen for events and consider the other nonresponsive, even though one side just missed the events.

An example of this situation can occur between the kgateway control plane and the Envoy gateway proxy. Envoy might listen for xDS configuration updates but not receive any. Because Envoy thinks that the connection is still alive, it does not try to reconnect to the kgateway control plane. Even though kgateway has a default TCP keepalive setting, you might find that you need to update the values. 

**Load balancer connection tracking**

Similar to the previous example with the kgateway control plane, the Envoy gateway proxy might miss connections with an external client. This situation happens when the Envoy gateway proxy is directly exposed on the public internet so that external end users can access your services.

In many production setups, you set up a load balancer between the end users and the gateway proxy, such as an [AWS application load balancer (ALB)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/introduction.html).

Some network load balancers (NLBs) use connection tracking to remember where to forward a packet to after the connection is established. If the connection is idle, the NLB might remove the connection from its connection tracking table. In this scenario, both sides still think that the connection is open. When the client sends a packet through the NLB, the NLB no longer knows where to forward the packet to and sends a `RESET` response to the client.

If the client does not automatically retry, this might show up as an error. You might see many `RESET` messages in the TCP stats and think that you have a network issue. By enabling TCP keepalive or adjusting its settings, you can help keep long-lived connections open and functional. For an example, see [TCP keepalive on downstream connections](#downstream).

## TCP keepalive on downstream connections {#downstream}

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
Currently Envoy does not support turning on TCP keepalive settings directly on downstream connections. Instead, you can use the generic socket options settings. Socket options can have considerable effects on performance, and might not be portable across platforms. As such, the configuration example in this guide is not suitable for every production environment. Also note that because these options are applied to the gateway listener, they affect all downstream connections. Be careful and adjust the settings for your specific environment.
{{< /callout >}}

Downstream connections are between the Envoy gateway proxy and the client that sends the request to your services. The client varies depending on your setup:

* The end user that sends a request.
* The Layer 4 or Layer 7 load balancer that forwards the request from the end user to the gateway proxy.

To enable TCP keepalive on downstream connections, create a [ListenerPolicy](/docs/about/policies/listeneroption/) resource that selects the Gateway resource with `targetRefs`.

The following example enables TCP keepalive probes between the client and the gateway proxy. The first probe is sent when the connection has been idle for 60 seconds (`TCP_KEEPIDLE`). After, each probe is sent every 20 seconds (`TCP_KEEPINTVL`). After no response for 2 consecutive probes (`TCP_KEEPCNT`), the connection is dropped.

```yaml
kubectl apply -f- <<EOF
apiVersion: gateway.kgateway.dev/v1alpha1
kind: ListenerPolicy

### Cleanup

```sh
kubectl delete listeneroption tcpkeepalive -n kgateway-system
```

## TCP keepalive on backend connections {#backend}

Backend connections are between the Envoy gateway proxy and your services, such as kgatewaybackends, Kubernetes services, external services, OTel collectors, TAP servers, cloud functions, or other destinations.

To enable TCP keepalive on backend connections, configure the following [ConnectionConfig](/docs/reference/api/connection/) settings in the
[Backend](/docs/reference/api/#backend/) resource.

The following example enables TCP keepalive probes between the gateway proxy and the backend connection. The first probe is sent when the connection has been idle for 60 seconds (`keepaliveTime`). After, a TCP keepalive probe is sent every 20 seconds (`keepaliveInterval`). After no response for 2 consecutive probes (`keepaliveProbes`), the connection is dropped.

```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.kgateway.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Backend
metadata: # collapsed for brevity
spec:
# the destination settings are omitted for brevity
  connectionConfig:
    tcpKeepalive:
      keepaliveInterval: 20 # seconds
      keepaliveProbes: 2 # number of probes
      keepaliveTime: 60 # seconds
```
