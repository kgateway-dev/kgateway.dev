Route traffic directly to an AWS EC2 instance. 

## Before you begin 

{{< reuse "docs/snippets/prereq.md" >}}

## Set up an AWS EC2 instance

1. Follow the AWS documentation to [launch an AWS EC2 instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EC2_GetStarted.html#ec2-launch-instance) with the following configuration: 
   * Use an `amazon linux` image. 
   * Configure the EC2 instance's security group to allow HTTP traffic on port 80. 
   * Add the following tags: 
     - `gateway-id: abcde123`
     - `gateway-tag: group1`
     - `version: v1.2.3`. 

2. Save the EC2 instance region and account ID as environment variables.

   ```sh
   export AWS_REGION=<us-east-2>
   export AWS_ACCOUNT_ID=<12-digit-account-ID>
   ```

3. [Connect to your EC2 instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EC2_GetStarted.html#ec2-connect-to-instance). 

4. Use the following script to set up a demo echo app that returns specific HTTP response codes. For example, a request to `http://$INSTANCE_IP/?code=404` returns a 404 HTTP response. 
   ```sh
   wget https://mitch-solo-public.s3.amazonaws.com/echoapp2
   chmod +x echoapp2
   sudo ./echoapp2 --port 81 &
   ```
   
5. Verify that you can reach the echo app. The following curl request returns the app's help menu. Replace `$INSTANCE_IP` with the IP address of your EC2 instance.
   
   ```sh
   curl http://$INSTANCE_IP/help
   ```

   Example output:

   ```
   usage:
   curl -v http://localhost:8080/?code=<httpCode>
     where httpCode is a http response code such as 200, 404, or 500
   
   /metrics - returns http response code metrics in the form:
     {"Counts":{"100":1,"200":3,"202":1}}
   
   /metrics/reset - resets the metrics
   
   /help - prints this message
   ```

## Create AWS credentials

Create AWS credentials for the EC2 instance so that {{< reuse "docs/snippets/product-name.md" >}} can connect to it. 

{{% callout type="info" %}}
The following example shows how to use a user's AWS access key ID and secret key to authenticate with AWS, and an AWS role to authorize access to the EC2 instance. This approach is recommended. However, you can also assign the required permissions to your AWS user directly and only use an AWS access key ID and secret key. 
{{% /callout %}}

1. Get the AWS access key ID and secret key of the user that you want to use to authenticate with AWS. For more information, see the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html). 

2. Create a Kubernetes secret that holds your AWS access key ID and secret key. 
   
   ```sh
   kubectl apply -f- <<EOF
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Secret
   metadata:
     name: gateway-tag-group1
     namespace: {{< reuse "docs/snippets/ns-system.md" >}}
   type: Opaque
   stringData:
     AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: <access_key>
     AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: <secret_key>
   EOF
    ```

3. Create an AWS role. 
   
   1. From the AWS console, navigate to **IAM** > **Roles**. 
   2. Click **Create Role**.
   3. Select **AWS account** as the type of trusted entity.
   4. Enter the 12-digit account ID of the account that has the EC2 instances that you want to route to.
   5. Assign the required permission. At a minimum, you must be able to describe EC2 instances. The following example shows a sample policy configuration. 
      
      ```json
      {
        "Version": "2012-10-17",
        "Statement": [
           {
               "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
               "Effect": "Allow",
               "Action": "ec2:DescribeInstances",
               "Resource": "*"
           }
        ]
      }
      ```

   6. Save the role ARN as an environment variable.

      ```sh
      export AWS_ROLE_ARN=arn:aws:iam::802411188784:role/docs-eks-cluster
      ```

4. Add your AWS user as a trusted entity to your role. 
   
   1. Open the AWS role that you created. 
   2. Navigate to the **Trust relationship** tab. 
   3. Edit the **Trusted entities** to allow your AWS user to assume this role. 
      ```json
      {
       "Version": "2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
           {
               "Effect": "Allow",
               "Principal": {
                   "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::<account-ID>:user/<user_ID>"
               },
               "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
               "Condition": {}
           }
       ]
      }
      ``` 
 
## Set up routing to your EC2 instance

Create a Backend that represents your EC2 instance.

1. Create a Backend that represents your EC2 instance. Replace the AWS region with the region that your instance is in. Also make sure to add the ARN of the AWS role that you created earlier. If you assigned the permissions directly to your AWS user, the AWS access key ID and secret key are sufficient to authenticate with AWS and access the EC2 instance. In this case, remove the `spec.awsEc2.roleArn` from your Backend configuration. 
   
   ```yaml
   kubectl apply -f- <<EOF              
   apiVersion: gateway.kgateway.dev/v1alpha1
   kind: Backend
   metadata:
     annotations:
     name: my-ec2-backend
     namespace: {{< reuse "docs/snippets/ns-system.md" >}}
   spec:
     type: AWS
     aws:
       accountId: '$AWS_ACCOUNT_ID'
       region: $AWS_REGION
       auth:
         type: Secret
         secret:
           name: gateway-tag-group1
   EOF
   ```

2. Create an HTTPRoute that routes traffic to the EC2 Backend. 
   
   ```yaml
   kubectl apply -f- <<EOF   
   apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
   kind: HTTPRoute
   metadata:
     name: ec2-route
     namespace: {{< reuse "docs/snippets/ns-system.md" >}}
   spec:
     hostnames:
     - ec2.example
     parentRefs:
     - group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
       kind: Gateway
       name: http
       namespace: {{< reuse "docs/snippets/ns-system.md" >}}
     rules:
     - backendRefs:
       - group: gateway.kgateway.dev
         kind: Backend
         name: my-ec2-backend
       matches:
       - path:
           type: PathPrefix
           value: /
   EOF
   ```

3. Send a request to your EC2 instance. 
   
   {{< tabs items="Cloud Provider LoadBalancer,Port-forward for local testing"  >}}
   {{% tab %}}
   ```sh
   curl -vik http://$INGRESS_GW_ADDRESS:8080/\?code\=500 -H "host: ec2.example:8080"
   ```
   {{% /tab %}}
   {{% tab  %}}
   ```sh
   curl -vik localhost:8080/\?code\=500 -H "host: ec2.example"
   ```
   {{% /tab %}}
   {{< /tabs >}}
   
   Example output: Note that the response code is 500, which is the response code that you specified in the request.
   
   ```
   * Mark bundle as not supporting multiuse
   < HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error
   HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error
   < date: Thu, 14 Nov 2024 20:01:57 GMT
   date: Thu, 14 Nov 2024 20:01:57 GMT
   < content-length: 0
   content-length: 0
   < x-envoy-upstream-service-time: 206
   x-envoy-upstream-service-time: 206
   < server: envoy
   server: envoy
   ```

   If you get a 404 error, make sure that your AWS credentials, secret, Backend, and HTTPRoute are correctly configured.

## Cleanup

1. Remove the Backend and HTTPRoute.
   
   ```sh
   kubectl delete httproute ec2-route -n {{< reuse "docs/snippets/ns-system.md" >}}
   kubectl delete backend my-ec2-backend -n {{< reuse "docs/snippets/ns-system.md" >}}
   ```

2. Delete the AWS role or revoke permissions for your user.  

3. Delete the AWS EC2 instance.
